# Application-error-test

This is an example for <https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/12791>

## Installation

* `git clone <repository-url>` this repository
* change into the new directory
* `npm install`
* `bower install`

## Running / Development

* `ember server`
* Visit your app at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).

### Running Tests

* `ember test`
* `ember test --server -m 'Acceptance | application-error'`

I added a debugger to show the workaround to pass the failing test.
